# FSV
*****This repo forked from FrancisRussell/fsv , and the modifications are completely ai driven as I'm not a programmer.****
Original Readme:
This repo is a fork of [fsv](http://fsv.sourceforge.net/), updated to current environments.
The original author is [Daniel Richard G.](https://github.com/iskunk), a former student of Computer Science at the MIT.

## About fsv

> fsv (pronounced eff-ess-vee) is a file system visualizer in cyberspace. It lays out files and directories in three dimensions, geometrically representing the file system hierarchy to allow visual overview and analysis. fsv can visualize a modest home directory, a workstation's hard drive, or any arbitrarily large collection of files, limited only by the host computer's memory and graphics hardware.

Its ancestor, SGI's `fsn` (pronounced "fusion") originated on IRIX and was prominently featured in Jurassic Park: ["It's a Unix system!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HjOjvu6oKA). 

[Screenshots](http://fsv.sourceforge.net/screenshots/) of the original clone are still available.

Useful info and screenshots of the original SGI IRIX implementation are available on [siliconbunny](http://www.siliconbunny.com/fsn-the-irix-3d-file-system-tool-from-jurassic-park/).

### Install

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (Ubuntu): `sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libepoxy-dev libcglm-dev`
   For Gtk4: `sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev`
    1. cglm is available as of Ubuntu 20.10. If cglm is not available
       system-wide, make a subdirectory under the project root and extract
        cglm there under the name cglm:
        1. `mkdir -p subprojects; cd subprojects`
        2. `tar xaf /path/to/cglm-version.tar.gz`
        3. `mv cglm-version cglm`
3. Run meson in repository root directory: `meson setup builddir`
    - Or set non-default options: `meson setup -Dbuildtype=release -Dprefix=~/.local builddir`
    - Check current options: `meson configure builddir`
    - Modify options on existing builddir: `meson configure -Doptimization=g builddir`
4. Compile: `ninja -C builddir`
5. Install: `sudo ninja -C builddir install`

## TODO

### DONE Update to Gtk+3

1. DONE Update code, still using gtk+2, to build cleanly with
   `meson configure -Dc_args="-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED" builddir`
2. DONE Update code, still using gtk+-2.0, to build cleanly with
   `meson configure -Dc_args="-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES -DGSEAL_ENABLE" builddir`
3. DONE Update to 'modern' OpenGL 3.1. GtkGLArea in Gtk+3 supports only core
   profile, so modernize the OpenGL code before switching to Gtk+3 and the
   OpenGL core profile.
    1. Build scaffolding to use shaders and VBO's. Bundle shaders using
       Gresource, compile and link shaders, use cglm for host side linear
       algebra instead of OpenGL 1.x matrix stack manipulation.
    2. Get rid of display lists, using VBO's and shaders inside display lists
       does not work properly.
    3. Replace deprecated GL_SELECT for picking objects. Maybe with something like
       http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/miscellaneous/clicking-on-objects/picking-with-an-opengl-hack/
    4. Convert immediate mode OpenGL code to VBO's, including switching from
       GL_QUADS to GL_TRIANGLES.
4. DONE Switch to Gtk+3

### Update to Gtk 4

Step by step instructions at https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/migrating-3to4.html

1. DONE While using Gtk 3, build cleanly with
   `meson configure -Dc_args="-DGDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED -DGTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED" builddir`

### Setup github actions for CI

### Use Gtk calendar

There exists commented out code for using gnome date edit widget
(gnome_date_edit_new etc.). Use gtk calendar widget instead.

## Misc notes

### OpenGL versions and compatibility

Gtk+3 tries to create a OpenGL 3.2 core context (since 3.16), and if that fails
it falls back to whatever legacy context it manages to create (since 3.20).
Thus one cannot assume availability of any legacy pre-3.2 API's that are
dropped in a core context. So for maximum compatibility use the oldest API's
still possible in 3.2.

For the shading language version, the latest [OpenGL core
specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/specs/gl/glspec46.core.pdf)
says "The core profile of OpenGL 4.6 is also guaranteed to support all previous
versions of the OpenGL Shading Language back to version 1.40". Thus GLSL 1.40
is the minimum version. This corresponds to OpenGL 3.1. However, it also says
that "OpenGL 4.6 implementations are guaranteed to support versions 1.00, 3.00,
and 3.10 of the OpenGL ES Shading Language.". So that is also an alternative.
There's also WebGL 2.0 that roughly corresponds to OpenGL ES 3.0 & OpenGL 3.3
and also uses GLSL ES 3.0.

Fsv is a relatively simple OpenGL application and doesn't need very fancy
features. Thus, aim for OpenGL 3.1 and GLSL 1.40 in order to provide maximum
compatibility.
